  <h1>SUCCESS!</h1>
  <p class="message">You successfully broke into the vault and scooped up all the treasures. As you leave the vault, you see red and blue lights in the far distance. Phew! That was a close one, maybe it's time to retire from this thief business. After all, you are getting a bit old. After looting that vault,
    you have more than enough riches to last you all throughout your retirement. It's time to live a nice, peaceful life!
